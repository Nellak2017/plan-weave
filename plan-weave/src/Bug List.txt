Bug List for Plan Weave:

// TODO: Go through Plan-Weave code and look for known bugs more than this

X FPS is 100 times too low -> Set to 30 fps // Molecule
X Start,End time clock not reverting back to basics after done choosing time // Molecule
X Start,End time not allowing 24 hour time choices // Molecule
calculateEfficiencyList is wrong, it is using eta as an ISO string but it is stored as epoch leading to TypeError
If Entering blank TTC it crashes the application and is unrecoverable (XTemp fix -> Set default to 0.1. Permanent fix -> make validation fail in a safe way)
If Entering a large Task, it crashes my app and user can't recover from it (XTemp Fix -> Limit Input. Permanent fix -> make validation cut it off and do no crash program!)
If the day ends, adjust start and end times to match new day NOT WORKING AS INTENDED. Causes many store updates and not what I wanted. (See TaskTable)
Add Task Adding Task before Completed Task
Completed Tasks being sorted and messing up ETA calculations
Efficiency and other fields potentially being undefined or not valid
Refresh Not really working the way it is supposed to. Not reseting tasks in Task Table (waste is showing multiple day instead of what it should be if it were for today).
TTC -> Hard to enter in .x, it rounds up to nearest (6 minutes) and you get wrong impression of eta
Ordering of Tasks -> It turns out that it is desirable to remember ordering between refreshes, fix this
Tasks not updating when Tabbed out of
Ordering of Tasks -> Tasks are given in reverse order of the way they are entered chronologically on refresh
